# NER-Biomedical
# Named Entity Recognition on Biomedical Texts
## Overview
This project, part of my graduation work at Helwan University, implements a machine learning pipeline for Named Entity Recognition (NER) on biomedical texts using Python, NLP libraries, and scikit-learn.

## Features
- Preprocesses biomedical text data.
- Extracts entities using NLP techniques.
- Evaluates model performance with standard metrics.

## Technologies
- Python
- scikit-learn
- NLTK/SpaCy (specify if used)

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbdulrhmanHussein/NER-Biomedical.git
